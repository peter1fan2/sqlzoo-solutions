6.Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.

SELECT teacher.name, COALESCE(dept.name, 'None') FROM teacher
LEFT JOIN dept ON teacher.dept = dept.id

8. Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.
--Difference between LEFT JOIN & RIGHT JOIN!!!
SELECT DISTINCT dept.name, COUNT(teacher.name) FROM teacher
RIGHT JOIN dept ON dept.id=teacher.dept
GROUP BY dept.name

name	COUNT(teacher..
Computing	3
Design	1
Engineering	0

-----------------------

SELECT DISTINCT dept.name, COUNT(teacher.name) FROM teacher
LEFT JOIN dept ON dept.id=teacher.dept
GROUP BY dept.name

name	COUNT(teacher..
          2
Computing	3
Design	1

9.Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.

  CASE WHEN condition1 THEN value1 
       WHEN condition2 THEN value2  
       ELSE def_value 
  END 
------------------------CASE
SELECT teacher.name, (
CASE
    WHEN teacher.dept = 1 THEN 'Sci'
    WHEN teacher.dept = 2 THEN 'Sci'
    ELSE 'Art'
END
) FROM teacher

10. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.

SELECT teacher.name, (
CASE
    WHEN teacher.dept IN (1,2) THEN 'Sci'
    WHEN teacher.dept = 3 THEN 'Art'
    ELSE 'None'
END
) FROM teacher
