JOIN

4.Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'
SELECT team1, team2, player 
FROM game
JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
WHERE player LIKE 'Mario%'

5. Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10
SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime
  FROM goal JOIN eteam ON (teamid=id)
 WHERE gtime<=10
 
6. List the the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.
SELECT mdate, teamname FROM game
JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id)
WHERE coach='Fernando Santos'

7. List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'
SELECT player FROM goal
JOIN game on (id=matchid)
WHERE stadium='National Stadium, Warsaw'

8(pre). all goals scored in the Germany-Greece quarterfinal.
SELECT player, gtime
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
    WHERE (team1='GER' AND team2='GRE')
    
8. show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany.
SELECT DISTINCT player
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
    WHERE (team1='GER' OR team2='GER') AND teamid != 'GER'
    
9. Show teamname and the total number of goals scored.
SELECT teamname, COUNT(teamid) FROM eteam
JOIN goal ON (id=teamid)
GROUP BY teamname

10. Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.
SELECT DISTINCT stadium, COUNT(matchid) FROM game
JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
GROUP BY stadium

11. For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.
SELECT matchid,mdate, COUNT(matchid)
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
 WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
GROUP BY matchid,mdate

12. For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'
SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(teamid) FROM game
JOIN goal ON matchid=id
WHERE teamid='GER'
GROUP BY matchid, mdate

13. List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.
mdate	team1	score1	team2	score2
1 July 2012	ESP	4	ITA	0
10 June 2012	ESP	1	ITA	1
10 June 2012	IRL	1	CRO	3
...
Notice in the query given every goal is listed. If it was a team1 goal then a 1 appears in score1, otherwise there is a 0. You could SUM this column to get a count of the goals scored by team1. Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.

SELECT mdate,
  team1,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),
  team2,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2

#### This is wrong because (JOIN default as INNER JOIN!!!!!)
SELECT mdate,
  team1,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),
  team2,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
  FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON matchid = id
GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2
