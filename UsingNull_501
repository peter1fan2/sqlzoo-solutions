# Selecting NULL values.
SELECT code, name FROM party
  WHERE leader IS NULL
  
#1.List the teachers who have NULL for their department.
SELECT name FROM teacher
  WHERE dept IS NULL
  
#2. Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher INNER JOIN dept
          ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)
           
#3. Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher LEFT JOIN dept
ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

#4. Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
FROM teacher RIGHT JOIN dept
ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

#Inserted: COALESCE
COALESCE takes any number of arguments and returns the first value that is not null.

  COALESCE(x,y,z) = x if x is not NULL
  COALESCE(x,y,z) = y if x is NULL and y is not NULL
  COALESCE(x,y,z) = z if x and y are NULL but z is not NULL
  COALESCE(x,y,z) = NULL if x and y and z are all NULL
  
1) COALESCE can be useful when you want to replace a NULL value with some other value. In this example you show the name of the party for each MSP that has a party. For the MSP with no party (such as Canavan, Dennis) you show the string None.
SELECT name, party
      ,COALESCE(party,'None') AS aff
  FROM msp WHERE name LIKE 'C%'
  
Result:
name	party	aff
Campbell MSP, Colin	SNP	SNP
Canavan MSP, Dennis		None
Chisholm MSP, Malcolm	Lab	Lab
Craigie MSP, Cathie	Lab	Lab
Crawford JP MSP, Bruce	SNP	SNP
Cunningham MSP, Roseanna	SNP	SNP
Curran MSP, Ms Margaret	Lab	Lab

#5. Use COALESCE to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'
SELECT name, 
COALESCE(mobile,'07986 444 2266') As mobile_number FROM teacher

#6. Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.
SELECT teacher.name, 
COALESCE(dept.name, 'None') AS deptname
FROM teacher LEFT JOIN dept
ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

#7. Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.
SELECT COUNT(name), COUNT(mobile) FROM teacher
GROUP BY name, mobile
#error: Wrong answer. Too many rows
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name), COUNT(DISTINCT mobile) FROM teacher

#8. Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.
SELECT dept.name, COUNT(teacher.dept)
FROM teacher 
RIGHT JOIN dept ON dept.id=teacher.dept
GROUP BY dept.name

#9. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.
SELECT teacher.name, 
COALESCE( 
IF(teacher.dept <=2, 'Sci','Art')
) AS deptname
FROM teacher LEFT JOIN dept
ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

#10. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.
SELECT teacher.name, 
COALESCE(CASE
WHEN teacher.dept <=2 THEN 'Sci'
WHEN teacher.dept =3 THEN 'Art' END,
'None') AS deptname
FROM teacher LEFT JOIN dept
ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

Quiz section
#1.  Select the code which uses an outer join correctly.
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name FROM teacher LEFT OUTER JOIN dept ON (teacher.dept = dept.id)

#2. Select the correct statement that shows the name of department which employs Cutflower -
SELECT dept.name FROM teacher JOIN dept ON (dept.id = teacher.dept) WHERE teacher.name = 'Cutflower'

#3.Select out of following the code which uses a JOIN to show a list of all the departments and number of employed teachers
SELECT dept.name, COUNT(teacher.name) FROM teacher RIGHT JOIN dept ON dept.id = teacher.dept GROUP BY dept.name

#4.Using SELECT name, dept, COALESCE(dept, 0) AS result FROM teacher on teacher table will:
display 0 in result column for all teachers without department

#5.Query:
SELECT name,
       CASE WHEN phone = 2752 THEN 'two'
            WHEN phone = 2753 THEN 'three'
            WHEN phone = 2754 THEN 'four'
            END AS digit
  FROM teacher
shows following 'digit':
'four' for Throd

#6.Select the result that would be obtained from the following code:
 SELECT name, 
      CASE 
       WHEN dept 
        IN (1) 
        THEN 'Computing' 
       ELSE 'Other' 
      END 
  FROM teacher
