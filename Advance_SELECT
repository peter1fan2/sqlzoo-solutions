FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe'
AND gdp/population > (
SELECT gdp/population FROM world
WHERE name = 'United Kingdom'

  WHERE population >= ALL
    (SELECT population FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND population>0)
          
SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
  WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area>0)          
8. List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.
SELECT continent, name FROM world x
  WHERE name <= ALL
    (SELECT name FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent)
        
9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.
SELECT name, continent, population
FROM world x
